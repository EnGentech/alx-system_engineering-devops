Every additional element in the web infrastructure is needed for redundancy, this is to enhance the avalability of resources when theres a break down of any server infrastructure

The algorithm of the load balancer in this sence uses a round-robin technique. The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring efficient unilization fo resources and high availability. 

Active-Passive Setup: In an active-passive setup, one server acts as the primary (active) while the other remain passive until the active server fails. the load balancer routes traffic to the active server, and in case of failure, it switches to the passive server.

Issues: The infrastructure lacks redundancy for each component, meaning that if any servr fails, the website will become unavailable.

Security Issues: The absence of a firwal exposes the servers to potential unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Added to that, the lack of HTTPS encryption poses a security risk during data transmission. 

Monitoring: There is no monitoring system in place to track server health, performance, or detect issues proactively, making it challenging to identify and resolve problems promtply.
